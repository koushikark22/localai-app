# LocalAI - Demo Video Script (3 minutes)

## Opening (0:00-0:30) - The Problem

**[Screen: Show person staring at phone, frustrated]**

**Narrator:**
"You need a romantic restaurant for your anniversary... or an emergency plumber at 2am. 
You open Yelp, see hundreds of options, and freeze. Which one is RIGHT for you?

Traditional search gives you data, but not decisions. LocalAI changes that."

## Act 1: Dining Use Case (0:30-1:15)

**[Screen: LocalAI homepage]**

**Narrator:**
"Meet LocalAI - your AI-powered local discovery assistant. Let's solve a real problem."

**[Type into search box]**
"Romantic Italian restaurant for anniversary dinner tonight at 7pm, quiet atmosphere preferred"

**[Click "Find matches"]**

**Narrator:**
"LocalAI uses Yelp's AI API to understand your intent conversationally. But here's where we're different..."

**[Screen: Results with confidence scores]**

**Narrator:**
"Every recommendation comes with an EXPLAINABLE confidence score. 
- High rating: check
- Strong review volume: check  
- Matches romantic intent: check
- Supports Yelp reservations: check

You're not guessing anymore. You KNOW why this is a good match."

**[Scroll to pitfall warnings]**

**Narrator:**
"And we warn you about pitfalls BEFORE you commit. 
'Popular times can be fully booked - have a backup ready.'
This is real-world wisdom, not just data dumps."

**[Click 'Book table']**

**[Screen: Booking panel with generated message]**

**Narrator:**
"LocalAI generates your reservation message. One click to copy, paste to Yelp or call directly. 
If that time's unavailable, we automatically suggest alternatives."

## Act 2: Home Services Use Case (1:15-2:00)

**[Screen: New search]**

**Narrator:**
"But LocalAI isn't just for dining. Let's try something completely different."

**[Type]**
"Emergency plumber for burst pipe in basement, need someone NOW"

**[Screen: Results]**

**Narrator:**
"Same intelligent matching, different domain. 
The confidence scoring adapts - now it looks for:
- Same-day availability mentions
- 24/7 service indicators
- Emergency response capability

And the pitfall warnings change too:
'Get an itemized estimate before work starts'
'Confirm trip fees and diagnostic charges'"

**[Click 'Request quote']**

**Narrator:**
"LocalAI helps you take the next action - whether it's booking a table or calling a plumber."

## Act 3: What Makes This Special (2:00-2:45)

**[Screen: Split screen showing features]**

**Narrator:**
"So what makes LocalAI special?

**ONE**: Explainable AI. You're not trusting a black box - you understand every recommendation.

**TWO**: Dual-purpose design. One app handles both life's pleasures AND life's emergencies.

**THREE**: We close the loop. Mark outcomes as resolved or not. Over time, we learn what actually works.

**FOUR**: Smart fallbacks. If your constraints are too strict, we automatically relax them intelligently. You NEVER get zero results.

**Technical highlights:**
- Built on Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- Leverages Yelp AI API's conversational capabilities  
- Responsive design with accessibility features
- Smart error handling and graceful degradation"

## Closing (2:45-3:00)

**[Screen: Outcome tracker showing resolved requests]**

**Narrator:**
"LocalAI isn't just another search wrapper. It's a decision support system that:
- Explains its recommendations
- Warns you about risks
- Helps you take action
- Tracks real outcomes

From romantic dinners to burst pipes, LocalAI turns local business data into confident decisions."
